Assignment 4: Test Design Techniques
1. Black-box vs White-box Testing

Black-box Testing üè¥

Focus: Tests the functionality of the software without knowing its internal code structure.

Goal: Verify outputs for given inputs.

Example: Checking if the login page accepts valid credentials and rejects invalid ones without looking at the source code.

White-box Testing ‚ö™

Focus: Tests internal code logic, structure, and paths.

Goal: Ensure each line, branch, and condition is executed and works as intended.

Example: Testing all if-else paths in a payment processing function.

Key Difference: Black-box = ‚ÄúWhat does it do?‚Äù, White-box = ‚ÄúHow does it do it?‚Äù.

2. Equivalence Partitioning (EP)

Definition: Dividing input data into groups (partitions) where all values in one group are expected to behave the same.

Purpose: Reduce the number of test cases while still ensuring good coverage.

Example:
Suppose an age field accepts 18‚Äì60 years:

Partition 1: Below valid range (e.g., 10)

Partition 2: Within valid range (e.g., 30)

Partition 3: Above valid range (e.g., 70)
Only 3 test cases are needed instead of testing every age.

3. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Definition: Testing values at the boundaries of input ranges because errors often occur there.

Example:
For an input range 1‚Äì100:

Lower boundary tests: 0, 1, 2

Upper boundary tests: 99, 100, 101

Why It Works: Developers often make mistakes handling "just inside" or "just outside" values.

4. Decision Table Testing

Definition: A tabular method to represent and test complex business rules with multiple conditions and actions.

Example:
Loan Approval

Condition: Credit Score ‚â• 700	Condition: Income ‚â• $50k	Action: Approve Loan
Y	Y	Yes
Y	N	No
N	Y	No
N	N	No

Benefit: Ensures all combinations of conditions are tested.

5. State Transition Testing

Definition: Testing software behavior when moving between different states based on events/inputs.

Example:
ATM Machine

State 1: Card Inserted ‚Üí State 2: Enter PIN

State 2: Correct PIN ‚Üí State 3: Access Account

State 2: Incorrect PIN (3 times) ‚Üí State 4: Card Blocked

Why It‚Äôs Useful: Perfect for systems where behavior depends on past events (e.g., authentication, workflows).

‚úÖ Summary:

Black-box & White-box testing address different perspectives of quality.

Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis cut down test cases while maintaining coverage.

Decision Tables ensure complex rules are fully tested.

State Transition Testing captures real-world usage flows.
